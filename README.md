# krakow-bus-map

Interactive web map of Kraków public transport (KMK) in the visual logic of the
official KMK network map: **164 bus lines and 23 tram lines** drawn exactly along
roadways and tracks (own HMM/Viterbi map matching on an OSM graph), line numbers
written parallel to every street they use, labeled stops, true roundabout arcs.

**Live map:** https://miqell24.github.io/krakow-bus-map/

## Two views

The panel's **Corridors / Lines** switch (ported from the Tricity map, 21.08.2026)
redraws the same network line by line: a roadway carrying up to four lines is
drawn as four coloured strands side by side (each line keeps one colour across the
whole map), anything busier becomes one grey trunk with its numbers beside it in
the lines' colours. `npm run lines` (`pipeline/lines.mjs`) derives the strand
files from `data/out/`; `npm run audit` checks the drawn result (torn ends,
folds, doubles, every line one connected piece).

## Features

- GTFS (ZTP Kraków) matched onto the OSM road/tram network — mean error ~0.3 m,
  data gaps in the feed bridged by graph routing, unmapped construction sites drawn
  from the raw trace.
- KMK-style rendering: one stroke per roadway, aggregated line numbers rotated
  parallel to streets, shared bus+tram corridors get a single two-color number
  segment, termini labeled with their lines.
- Poster-style base map (warm tinted districts, green parks, blue water,
  pale-yellow motorways), narrow Roboto Condensed labels, stops drawn as
  half-discs oriented to the pole's side of the street, termini as filled discs.
- Panel with bus/tram visibility filters and a clickable line list (click a line to
  see its route with all stops).
- Poster-grade PNG export: the current view re-rendered in tiles at ~+3 zoom levels
  of extra detail (street and stop names become legible as you zoom into the image).
- GTFS shapes.txt quality report (`npm run report` → `data/gtfs-gaps-report.md`).

## Requirements

Node ≥ 18 (no npm dependencies), `curl`, `unzip`, internet on first run.

## Usage

```bash
npm run download   # ZTP GTFS + OSM (Overpass) + MapLibre (cached in data/ and web/vendor/)
npm run build      # extraction + map matching + GeoJSON files into data/out/
npm run serve      # http://localhost:8124
```

## Structure

- `pipeline/download.sh` — input data download
- `pipeline/build.mjs` — GTFS → OSM graph → HMM/Viterbi → `data/out/*.geojson`
- `pipeline/lib/` — csv (streaming), geo (local projection), graph (graph + Dijkstra), hmm (Viterbi)
- `pipeline/report-gaps.mjs` — GTFS shapes.txt gap report
- `web/` — MapLibre GL frontend (vendored, OpenFreeMap positron tiles)
- `docs/` — static bundle published via GitHub Pages (web + data/out copies)
